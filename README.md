# Forest Fire Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of forest fires on atmospheric parameters, particularly ozone (O3) concentration, and other meteorological variables. The analysis aims to understand the correlation between forest fires and atmospheric conditions, providing insights into environmental impacts and potential forecasting models.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Utilizes netCDF files containing atmospheric data from various locations and time periods.
- **Parameter Analysis**: Extracts ozone concentration, edge height (H), and vertical pressure velocity (OMEGA) from the netCDF files.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations, such as time series plots and correlation matrices, to analyze the relationship between forest fires and atmospheric parameters.
- **Regression Analysis**: Performs regression analysis to quantify the impact of forest fires on ozone concentration and other meteorological variables.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- netCDF4

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to analyze the forest fire data and generate visualizations.
4. Explore the results and insights provided by the analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate machine learning algorithms for advanced prediction models.
- Expand the analysis to include additional atmospheric parameters and geographical regions.
- Develop a web-based interface for interactive exploration of the data and results.
